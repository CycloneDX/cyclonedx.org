# OWASP CycloneDX SBOM Standard Launches Educational Learning Series
**16 August 2021**


The OWASP CycloneDX project, creators of the leading Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) format, announced the
immediate availability of the CycloneDX Learning Series. The series of short-form content provides an easy path to
explore and learn the CycloneDX SBOM standard.

CycloneDX is a modern, security focused SBOM specification supporting a wide range of cybersecurity, legal, and software
distribution use cases. The CycloneDX Learning Series launches today with four episodes aimed at educating the public
about the benefits of SBOMs, and CycloneDX specifically.

"_We've learned a lot from the thousands of organizations using CycloneDX today, and we wanted to share that knowledge
with the wider community._" says Steve Springett, Chair of the CycloneDX Core Working Group. "_With the recent Executive
Order in the U.S., there's a rush to understand SBOM capabilities and their impact to the organizations that need to
produce or consume them. So it was important for us to provide an authoritative source of learning material and best
practices the community can leverage to kickstart their SBOM efforts_".

The [CycloneDX Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqjEqUxHjy1X9nGMcjS1ikwxFMZAB2uea) consists of
over thirty episodes, four of which are immediately available on the
[CycloneDX YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUKDc0izYoyQKdzAsraoUQ). Future episodes will be published
throughout the remainder of the year.

##### **About CycloneDX**

OWASP CycloneDX is a lightweight software bill of materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security
contexts and supply chain component analysis. The CycloneDX project provides standards in XML, JSON, and Protocol
Buffers, as well as a large collection of official and community supported tools that create or interoperate with the
standard. The project operates as an independent meritocracy whose guiding principles reinforce its risk-based approach
to standards development. The project encourages community participation in the development of the standard and supporting tools.
CycloneDX is a flagship OWASP standards project. Visit [https://cyclonedx.org](https://cyclonedx.org) for more information.
