# CycloneDX v1.6: Now an Ecma International Standard
**01 July 2024**

OWASP is excited to announce that CycloneDX v1.6 has been officially ratified as an Ecma International standard, 
CycloneDX Bill of materials specification, following a decisive vote at  the Ecma General Assembly on 26 June. 
This milestone sets the stage for CycloneDX Bill of materials being available as a global xBOM (Bill of Materials) 
standard for use across multiple domains. CycloneDX is proud to be an OWASP Flagship standards project, and in a 
community development model with Ecma International’s TC54, underscoring its importance and impact in the industry.

#### **A Comprehensive Standard for the Software Supply Chain**
CycloneDX v1.6 stands out as the global xBOM standard that holistically supports a wide range of assets, including 
software, services, hardware, firmware, AI/ML, and cryptography. This broad coverage is crucial in today’s complex 
and interconnected technology landscape, enabling organizations to achieve comprehensive visibility and management 
across their entire supply chain.

* **Software**: Ensures detailed transparency and management of software components, vital for addressing security vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance.
* **Services**: Covers third-party services, providing insights into potential risks and dependencies that could impact operational integrity.
* **Hardware and Firmware**: Facilitates robust management and security of physical components and embedded systems, crucial for sectors like IoT and critical infrastructure.
* **AI/ML**: Addresses the growing need to manage and secure machine learning models and data, essential for maintaining trust and performance in AI-driven applications.
* **Cryptography**: Ensures secure handling and implementation of cryptographic assets, including Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness as outlined in [NIST SP 1800-38B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/1800/38/iprd-(1)). This is a fundamental aspect of protecting data integrity and confidentiality from evolving threats.

#### **Ideal for Holistic Supply Chain and Advanced Cybersecurity Use Cases**

CycloneDX v1.6 is specifically designed to meet the demands of holistic supply chain management and advanced 
cybersecurity use cases. By providing a detailed and comprehensive view of the entire supply chain, CycloneDX 
enables organizations to identify and mitigate risks effectively, ensuring resilience and security.


#### **Unmatched License Support**

One of the standout features of CycloneDX v1.6 is its advanced license support, which holistically helps to 
facilitate open-source license compliance and supports commercial license management and procurement scenarios.
This capability is critical for organizations navigating the complexities of software licensing, ensuring compliance
and optimizing procurement processes.


#### **Wide Industry Support**

CycloneDX has garnered wide industry support, with over 220 tools now supporting the standard. This extensive 
ecosystem demonstrates the trust and adoption by the industry, making CycloneDX a reliable and effective choice 
for organizations looking to enhance their supply chain security and management.

#### **Quotes**

<blockquote class="press-release">
<p>The ratification of CycloneDX Bill of materials specification as an Ecma International standard is a testament to 
the effectiveness of the community model established by Technical Committee 54 (TC54). This model is a benchmark
for future technical committees and the CycloneDX Bill of materials specification is just the beginning, with 
several other supply chain standards expected to emerge from TC54.</p>

#### **About Ecma Technical Committee (TC54)**

The Ecma Technical Committee 54 (TC54) is responsible for drafting the CycloneDX Bill of materials specification and
other related initiatives. Operating under a community development model, the committee is dedicated to standardizing
core data formats, APIs, and algorithms that advance software and system transparency.

Among TC54's ongoing projects is the standardization of Package URL (purl), a specification for identifying and locating
software packages. This is crucial for managing dependencies and vulnerabilities across diverse software ecosystems.
Another key initiative is the Transparency Exchange API, designed for the efficient sharing of supply chain artifacts 
and intelligence, further enhancing the security and transparency of supply chains.
