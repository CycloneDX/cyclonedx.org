## About the Guide
CycloneDX is a modern standard for the software supply chain.

The content in this guide results from continuous community feedback and input from leading experts in the software 
supply chain security field. This guide would not be possible without valuable feedback from the CycloneDX Industry 
Working Group (IWG), the CycloneDX Core Working Group (CWG), the many CycloneDX Feature Working Groups (FWG), 
CycloneDX maintainers and a global network of contributors and supporters.
