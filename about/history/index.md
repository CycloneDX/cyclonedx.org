## Project History
CycloneDX was designed in 2017 for use with [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org). An open-source 
Component Analysis platform that identifies risk in the software supply chain. The primary use-cases CycloneDX was 
designed to solve were vulnerability identification, license compliance, and outdated component analysis. Additional 
capabilities were added in subsequent releases of the specification.

The value of a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) specification, capable of achieving real-world usecases, transcends
the boundaries of a single vendor or supplier. Therefore, a dedicated open source project was
founded to develop the specification, the implementations, and move the format into widespread adoption. Today, hundreds of thousands
of organizations ranging from financial services, manufacturing, government, software, and security firms are producing
and consuming CycloneDX SBOMs.
